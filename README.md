The dataset that is being used is from Chicago Data Portal of Chicago Crimes from 2001 
to the present date. The dataset contains the types of crime, dates, location, ward number, 
if there was an arrest, if the crime was domestic abuse, etc. 

An important note about this dataset is that it can be updated so the more recent data may 
not be as accurate because it can still be updated. Additionally, domestic crimes are not 
considered a type of crime because of the Domestic Violence Prevention and Services 
Act,1980. This act provides the help people need when the crime is domestic, but the 
crime itself is more specific. Therefore, the dataset has a column where it checks if the 
crime is domestic or not; it is as shown as true or false. 

When we first started to work with the dataset, we found that recordings of crime had 
been lowering after around 2010 when we thought it would rise. Yet, along with the 
information that shows the number of arrests made with the number of crimes reported, 
we began to question if the recording of crime was indeed lowering perhaps because of 
laws or other factors that go with the actions of dealing accordingly with each crime or if 
perhaps people did not report crimes that exist for reasons unknown. Yet, we continued 
with the other questions that were previously submitted as this question would require 
further research that would be more time consuming and take away the focus of the 
general dataset that we want to learn from.


In order to transform the data, we cleaned the data so there was no null data and we can 
keep the data that is useful to use in the visualizations. After we cleaned the data, we 
renamed some of the columns and the dataset so it would be easier to call and encode. We 
also searched for examples of how to encode and transform the data with VegaLite. Once 
we found examples that were useful to us, we used the templates to fit the visualizations 
we wanted to create. Overall for the colors with the graphs on the Statics graphs page, we 
chose blue as it is a color that is easier to see and for the heatmaps, either green or red 
was used as again, they are easier for people to see. If the question we wanted to answer 
had to do with change over time, we would use a linear graph as that graph shows change 
over time the best. All else could be used with bar graphs if we wanted to show quantity. 
In general, when it came to showing data with the wards of Chicago, we used what made 
sense when comparing two numbers, such as a count and ID, and matching an amount to 
a ward as one would with matching a count to a distinct ID. Overall, the spatial graph is 
the best way to show data with wards as it helps a person put a visual to the ward number. 

The interactions of the visualizations will be in the captions of the screenshots of the 
visualizations below.
